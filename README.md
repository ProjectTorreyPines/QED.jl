# QED: Q Evolution by Diffusion

This evolves the rotational transform Î¹ (inverse of the safety factor q) in time according to a loop voltage. For now, only Ohmic current is considered. Eventually noninductive current will be added.

Equations implemented can be found in [equations_readme.pdf](equations_readme.pdf) and borrow extensively from:
Jardin, Stephen. *Computational Methods in Plasma Physics*. CRC Press, 2010.
